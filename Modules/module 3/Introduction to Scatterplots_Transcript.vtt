00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
So in this module,

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.725
we want to discuss one of the most common

3
00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:09.480
two-dimensional visualization methods scatterplots.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.690
Basically, we want to think about how we can apply methods

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.800
of visualizing discrete data values along two axes.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.940
The scatterplot is one that most people have seen in some form or

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.905
another created in Excel or PowerPoint or Tableau.

8
00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:30.420
Any of these softwares have this and essentially what scatterplot is doing,

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.669
is it's trying to let us look at how two variables are related.

10
00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:40.160
So for example, we can think about baseball players.

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.440
So, I may have a baseball player,

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.230
I may have their batting average,

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.000
I may have their percent on base and other sort of statistics.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.720
You don't like baseball you can think of this as soccer, football,

15
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.455
you can think of this as a quiz scores,

16
00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:04.910
any sort of data set where we have,

17
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.335
some sort of measures and values and we want to compare to.

18
00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:14.560
We talked about how we can do batting averages, a 1D case, right?

19
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.525
So, for each players, I'm going to have player one,

20
00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.140
then I might have their batting average is the bar,

21
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.240
I might have player two and their batting average and player

22
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.810
three and their batting average and so forth and then we can also have player one,

23
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.870
two, three by the percent on base.

24
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630
We may have a question of well,

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.445
how does batting average relate to percent of getting onto base?

26
00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:41.420
So, to do that, we may want to think about how we can create

27
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.000
some graphical representation to allow people to

28
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.995
understand these relationships and for just two variables and

29
00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:52.490
the most common sort of visualization is a scatterplot where we

30
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.265
can visualize discrete data values along two axes,

31
00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:58.730
we can analyze bivariate relationships,

32
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.960
we can quickly sort of look for outliers,

33
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.350
clusters, distributions and we can also identify trend lines.

34
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.400
So, imagine if I show you a scatterplot that looks like this,

35
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.970
immediately you start thinking to yourself,

36
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.550
why is there a group of data here and a group of data here?

37
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.705
What is the relationship between the two?

38
00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:25.145
If I add another point way out here,

39
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.585
you might say why is that single lone point way out there?

40
00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:30.130
Is that an outlier?

41
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.340
What's going on? Likewise, if I show you

42
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.400
a plot with points that sort of go in this manner,

43
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.570
you can quickly start seeing the trend and asking why we

44
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.210
might have some sort of trend that fits this sort of exponential looking curve?

45
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.220
So, by plotting these values against each other,

46
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.480
we can start asking questions and if we do things like batting average versus percent on

47
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.105
base and if we start seeing some sort

48
00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:05.965
of plot like this and we may have some outliers even.

49
00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:10.010
But, we sort of see a trend through our data and we might start saying,

50
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.185
well, it seems like batting average may match percent on base.

51
00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:18.450
It could be in class that if I plot say,

52
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.070
quiz one versus the final exam score,

53
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.050
we may find that for some reason quiz one is

54
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.750
highly correlated to the final exam scores and students

55
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.685
who did well on quiz one early in the semester stick it out and do well on the final.

56
00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:39.280
These things might help us to identify average students.

57
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.285
If you're down here on quiz one,

58
00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:44.840
next semester and I know this is correlated I might come to people and say, "Hey,

59
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.610
students who did bad on quiz one

60
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.580
really need to improve because they tend to do bad on the final."

61
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.030
So, we can start using this information to make decisions,

62
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.610
talk about interesting facts and the data,

63
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.510
help people understand trends and what those trends mean.

64
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.210
So, in creating a scatterplot we can plot

65
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.980
things like the number of runs and the batting average.

66
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.840
So, again, any sorts of variables I have

67
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.240
in my dataset and then each point here is a different player.

68
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.310
So, again, you have to think about what questions you want to answer with the data,

69
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.600
what labels you might want to have,

70
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.660
what interactions you might want to have and what we're trying to see.

71
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.020
So, here we might see some sort of trend maybe we could even try

72
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.380
to fit some sort of regression line and we'll talk about how to do

73
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.310
regression in different lectures to the plot to try to

74
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.570
see is there some way I can model the data to explain the different patterns within it?

75
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.640
Can identify outliers, for example?

76
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.790
So, this person had a really low number of runs,

77
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.100
but a reasonably high batting average same with this person actually,

78
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.210
one of the higher batting averages,

79
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.995
but some of the lowest number of runs.

80
00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:56.780
We could think about adding interaction.

81
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.760
So, imagine if this was my mouse tool tip and I can point to the element on the screen,

82
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.210
it might be able to pull up the label to say this is player number seven,

83
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.900
for example and tell us who that is,

84
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.895
tell us more information.

85
00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:13.175
Again, we can think about,

86
00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:15.770
how do we want to fix the aspect ratio,

87
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.175
should I've made this axis much much longer than the other axis?

88
00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:22.490
How do I manage and manipulate those things?

89
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.940
So, all of these different elements we've talked about in past modules from

90
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.420
aspect ratios to nice numbers to graph and labels,

91
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.425
all come into play in creating our scatterplot here.

92
00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:37.125
We don't have to just stick with two variables in a scatterplot.

93
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:44.125
So, there's a really fun video by Hans Rosling if you go to gapminder.org.

94
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:49.400
Hans Rosling does this nice animated PowerPoint where each bubble

95
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.470
here is a country and he's showing income versus life expectancy.

96
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.320
As he shows this move over time you get a story of

97
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.520
the world and how income has shifted life expectancy.

98
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.530
So, if we think about a data set like that,

99
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.580
we can think about we have a country,

100
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.410
we have an income,

101
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.850
we have life expectancy,

102
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:21.400
we can even do things like population and we could add in another variable like GDP,

103
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.130
we can even look at things that they trade,

104
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.360
we can look at the percent of trade to other countries,

105
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.440
all sorts of variables about different countries and then

106
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.630
we can start thinking about what visual variables do we

107
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.370
have and we talked about Britain seven visual variables.

108
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.710
So, we had position on x and y.

109
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.300
So, this combination alone creates a scatterplot.

110
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.870
So, each country becomes a circle on the screen, okay?

111
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.245
So, then we get shape if we want.

112
00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:58.660
So, we chose shape as our circle here,

113
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.590
color matches to something and we can see lots of colors being reused.

114
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.540
Notice, we don't have a legend here.

115
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.250
What Hans Rosling did was match color to certain chunks of the world and so you

116
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.980
had North America, South America, Europe.

117
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.280
I'm not a very good artist.

118
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.570
Afrika, Australia, and each chunk of the world might

119
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.800
have been some slightly different color.

120
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.660
So, we get color, we get shape, we get position,

121
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.345
we can even think about adding a texture to these circles if we wanted.

122
00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:41.595
They gets sort of busy.

123
00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:43.985
Notice we have different sizes.

124
00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:45.890
So, we have size in the circle,

125
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.800
and here size corresponds to something like population.

126
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.115
Color corresponded to location in the world.

127
00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:57.390
So, we're combining these different visual variables together to

128
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.625
move past just this 2D representation,

129
00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:03.655
where we had variable X versus variable Y,

130
00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:05.355
it's now multiple variables.

131
00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:07.620
Then he even adds in animation.

132
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.210
So we can move our data over time and so animation

133
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.405
provides us with yet another variable to see trends and patterns and changes over time.

134
00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:22.700
There's nice work on looking at animated scatterplots by John Stascho.

135
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.445
So, you can take a look, I encourage you to watch Hans Rosling's Gapminder video,

136
00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:33.925
just to see how his nice presentation goes for these multivariate cases.

137
00:08:33.925 --> 00:08:36.220
Now the real question though is,

138
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.165
if I have all of these datasets which scatterplots should I draw off?

139
00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:45.400
If I have all of these variables like income, life expectancy, population,

140
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.410
I can create a ton of different scatterplots for every two variables,

141
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.890
I can make a scatterplot for GDP vs the percentage of trade,

142
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.540
I can make a scatterplot for GDP versus life expectancy,

143
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.970
I can make a scatterplot for GDP versus population.

144
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.925
So, the more variables I have,

145
00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:06.280
the more scatterplots that I can make.

146
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.910
So, I want to think about how do I

147
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.380
help people again detect the expected, discover the unexpected?

148
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.530
How do I identify anomalies in these scatterplots?

149
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.865
How did you identify interesting trends?

150
00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:24.130
One way is through what was coined as Scagnostics.

151
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:31.870
So, this was, Tukey coined this back in the early 80's,

152
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.250
talking about graph theoretic measures for

153
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.470
detecting structural anomalies in scatterplots.

154
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.280
So, if I draw a scatterplot,

155
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.400
what are the different things that I'm seeing?

156
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.115
So, for example, remember when I drew a scatterplot that had properties like this,

157
00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:49.470
notice this has a clumpiness property.

158
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.505
Is there a way where I can theoretically have some mathematical computation of that?

159
00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:57.385
This may be a really interesting view to say, "Hey,

160
00:09:57.385 --> 00:10:02.790
these particular elements are highly related in these two variables."

161
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.540
So, we can use these graph theoretic measures to help

162
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.220
users pick views to show particular structures of interest.

163
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.950
This was coined by Tukey to help us determine

164
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.550
which relationships between variables should we pick?

165
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.630
If I don't have time or capacities to show every possible Pairwise combination.

166
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.780
Which is the best Pairwise combination to show?

167
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.095
Which is the second best?

168
00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:30.940
And so forth. So, Scagnostics gives us

169
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.460
a bunch of different equations that we can start calculating.

170
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.840
So, for example, we can figure out

171
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.795
the minimum convex hole that will enclose all of our points.

172
00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:45.189
So, for example, the minimum convex hole if I draw some points on the screen,

173
00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:47.360
the minimum convex hole is what's

174
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.240
the smallest polygon that's going to connect all of these together.

175
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:59.680
We can measure things like area of this polygon to try to do some measure,

176
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.680
we can have some sort of correlation measures to talk about how correlated the data is,

177
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.070
and other elements like that.

178
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.730
There's a whole list of Scagnostics and people have been

179
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.145
working on those sorts of measures for a very long time.

180
00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:18.365
Wilkinson proposed nine Scagnostic measures to characterize scatterplots.

181
00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:22.190
So, outlying, sparse, striated,

182
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:27.775
skinny, monotonic, skewed, clumpy, convex, and stringy.

183
00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:32.080
All of these have a different equation associated with them but what's nice is

184
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.690
wilkinson developed the library where we can calculate all of these automatically,

185
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.230
and start using these to try and rank scatterplots.

186
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.320
Again, trying to think about importance in

187
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.765
showing people what's important and interested in their data.

188
00:11:45.765 --> 00:11:48.635
We've talked about Shneiderman's information mantra

189
00:11:48.635 --> 00:11:51.135
where it's overview first, zoom and filter,

190
00:11:51.135 --> 00:11:54.710
details on demand, and Daniel Keim talked

191
00:11:54.710 --> 00:12:00.220
about visual analytics mantra for analyze first as opposed to overview first.

192
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.340
So, if you have a large dataset you put it into some sort

193
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.990
of analytical framework whether it's going to be deep learning,

194
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:15.680
whether it's going to be supervised learning through clustering,

195
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.180
unsupervised learning through clustering,

196
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.180
whether it's going to be supervised learning through decision trees, things like that.

197
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.525
Whether it's going to be creating a bunch of scatterplots and measuring

198
00:12:24.525 --> 00:12:29.760
how outlying the particles are or how skewed the particles are?

199
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.435
We can use these measures to then characterize different scatterplots.

200
00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:38.100
What's nice about scatterplots is we

201
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.665
can also create what's called the scatterplot matrix.

202
00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:45.220
So, even if I have a whole lot of variables for a scatterplot,

203
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.130
I can actually go ahead and organize these into a matrix where I can

204
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.635
do each variable versus each other variable.

205
00:12:53.635 --> 00:12:55.890
So for example, I have At Bats,

206
00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:04.520
every Y-axis, I'm sorry every X-axis in this direction is the same.

207
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.900
So, we see we have our At Bats here.

208
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:14.365
So, every X axis is At Bats across our row.

209
00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:24.070
Across our columns, we get changes in variables.

210
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.670
So, here we get At Bats versus At Bats,

211
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.490
we get Runs versus Runs,

212
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.685
we get Batting Average versus Batting Average.

213
00:13:33.685 --> 00:13:35.815
In this example here,

214
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:41.030
we've got Batting Average and Runs,

215
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.675
we've got At Bat and Runs.

216
00:13:44.675 --> 00:13:47.870
So, we can start looking and see if there's any interesting trends.

217
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.880
Now the diagonal is always going to be these straight lines,

218
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.385
this is due to the fact that we're plotting the same variable against it self,

219
00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:57.885
so it should be highly correlated.

220
00:13:57.885 --> 00:14:03.130
So again, each dot is a baseball player and we can start looking for trends and patterns.

221
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.495
Here we might say well,

222
00:14:04.495 --> 00:14:06.620
there's one outlier in this plot

223
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.950
otherwise it looks like it might have some sort of trend here.

224
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.105
Here we may not see much relationship here,

225
00:14:14.105 --> 00:14:18.890
but scatterplots let us get a quick overview and the problem is

226
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.170
I could have rearranged any row and any column in any way I want.

227
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.590
So, I could have swapped these two columns or

228
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:32.010
these two rows and I would get a different order,

229
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.490
a different layout and how I'm going to go through

230
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.490
these orders and layouts is really important and can take time.

231
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.790
That's where we might want to use these Scagnostic measures to think about

232
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.960
how we can order what we call our scatterplot matrix.

233
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.080
We can even think about adding an interaction,

234
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.420
and adding interaction allows viewers to visualize other combinations of variables.

235
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.625
So, if I have a scatter plot in two dimensions,

236
00:14:55.625 --> 00:14:58.654
I can always extrude a third dimension

237
00:14:58.654 --> 00:15:02.140
and rotate my points and show what this looks like.

238
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.930
Nicholas Elmphast has a nice paper called rolling the dice,

239
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.970
and you can take a look at some of the nice interactions he added

240
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.370
in with these scatterplot matrices and

241
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:21.250
allowing extensions and things to let people visualize this in 3-dimensional space.

242
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.835
Again, we can add color to the points,

243
00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:26.675
we can add some shape or sizes,

244
00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:31.040
all sorts of things to add more information into these variables.

245
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.220
Now, the other thing we should have realized with scatterplots is

246
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.120
that really I'm just showing a whole bunch of the same thing over and over.

247
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.480
I have the same type of plot repeated over and

248
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.990
over but showing different combinations to my variables.

249
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:55.005
This display is sometimes referred to as small multiples or a trellis display.

250
00:15:55.005 --> 00:15:58.910
Essentially, what you might do is if you have a bunch of

251
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.240
different data you might want to try to

252
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.680
organize it in some way we can look at an overview of it all at once.

253
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.710
So for example, what if I want to look at homicide rates in Canada.

254
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.365
So, Canada has several different provinces.

255
00:16:12.365 --> 00:16:15.110
I've captured homicide rates over time,

256
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.660
and I don't want to maybe just make one plot for

257
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.530
the homicide rate in Canada because I may see something like this.

258
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.310
Or, even worse, I may see my homicide rate go up.

259
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.720
This may not tell the whole story,

260
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.775
if I break this down by province,

261
00:16:28.775 --> 00:16:31.120
I can see some interesting trends.

262
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.315
So for example, in Abbotsford Mission,

263
00:16:33.315 --> 00:16:38.610
I see this huge spike and decline in 2009.

264
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:43.280
I can see that Calgary had a downward trend and now it's back on an upswing.

265
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.510
I can see Montreal has been low and slowly declining.

266
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.420
The same for Toronto,

267
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.045
I've another case I'm seeing much more variability.

268
00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:57.110
So, this allows me to quickly compare between different elements of my data,

269
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.135
in this case provinces and look at the changes over time.

270
00:17:01.135 --> 00:17:05.670
Again I can think about how do I want to organize my small multiples here?

271
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.480
What's the different layout that I want to show

272
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.490
to the user to help them compare these quickly over time?

273
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.235
Do I want to put Abbotsford next to Calgary?

274
00:17:14.235 --> 00:17:17.990
Are these geographically located next to each other in Canada?

275
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.530
Do I want to organize these based on most similar trends?

276
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.870
So for example, should I put Toronto next to

277
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.525
Montreal because they have similar sorts of graphs?

278
00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:33.260
So, this allows us yet another mechanism to start thinking about how we can show

279
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:39.910
multiple variables on one screen with information about trends and changes over time,

280
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.725
to look for relationships?

281
00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:48.890
Again, we can start thinking about how we might pre analyze the data,

282
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.580
to identify interesting things so we know where to start

283
00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:57.650
visualizing to help and give the user more information.

284
00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.420
So, that takes us through this concept of scatterplots,

285
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.565
extending those to scatterplot matrices,

286
00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:09.130
and even further to small multiples. Thank you.
