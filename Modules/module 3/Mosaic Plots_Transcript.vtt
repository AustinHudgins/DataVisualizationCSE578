00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.925
So in this module,

2
00:00:01.925 --> 00:00:06.085
what we want to talk about is how to apply methods of visualizing

3
00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:13.685
discrete data values using area plots that we call mosaic plots.

4
00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.320
Mosaic plots are different than scatter plots,

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.085
parallel coordinate plots, Chernoff faces,

6
00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:25.990
and that we're really trying to take a piece of screen real estate,

7
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.450
and break it up into chunks to allow us to

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.155
examine the relationship among categorical variables now.

9
00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:36.615
So we talked about some categorical variables in parallel sets,

10
00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.865
and we're going to go back to that example of the Titanic,

11
00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:42.950
where essentially we want to think about how we

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.395
can demonstrate different categories of data.

13
00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:51.055
And so, in the Titanic data set remember we had gender.

14
00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.335
We had male and female.

15
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.620
We had categories of first class,

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.260
second class, third class, and crew.

17
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.985
We also had survivor versus non-survivor.

18
00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:10.230
And so we can create a whole set of data

19
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.110
like this where we know how many females were in first class?

20
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.875
How many survived? How many didn't?

21
00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:21.640
And so by adding the survivors versus the non-survivors,

22
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.380
I know how many females were in first class, and so forth.

23
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.940
And what a Mosaic plot is going to do is it's going

24
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.760
to take a square piece of real estate,

25
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.750
and we're going to split this square up.

26
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.625
We are going to divide it into either horizontal bars or vertical bars first,

27
00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:42.400
then we're going alternating back and forth between these horizontal and vertical splits.

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.965
And we're going to wind up with something like this.

29
00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:49.410
So, here's the actual Titanic data set.

30
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.230
So, we can count how many people were in first class.

31
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.520
So right away, we can count.

32
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.345
We have 197 people in first class.

33
00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:01.590
So let's talk about how we interpret this Mosaic plot.

34
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.415
So this length is,

35
00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:06.490
in theory, the same as this length.

36
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:15.835
And what we're doing is splitting this up along sort of different chunks.

37
00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:20.000
First, we want to count how many people are in our entire data set.

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.695
So to count how many people are in the Titanic,

39
00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:25.175
we add up all of these numbers.

40
00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:28.660
We also have to add all of the children as well.

41
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.380
Let's erase some of this so we can see this a little bit more.

42
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.155
So that tells me how many people were on the boat.

43
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.750
So let's say I add all these up,

44
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.990
and let's just say it works out.

45
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.725
We had thousand people on the Titanic.

46
00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:40.920
It doesn't, and if you add this up,

47
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.930
you'll get a different number.

48
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.760
But let's just pretend for now we've added every number up here.

49
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.710
So this is the total population of the Titanic.

50
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.990
So what a Mosaic plot is going to do is we want to know

51
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.070
what percentage of this population was female,

52
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.835
and what percentage was male.

53
00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:07.680
And so let's say that of the total population on the Titanic,

54
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.605
700 were male, and 300 were female.

55
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:14.400
So what we do on this gender axis,

56
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.500
and we get to pick how we want to split this.

57
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.080
So if I say my first split is going to be on gender,

58
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.600
I take this axis,

59
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.990
and I split it up into zero to one.

60
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.080
So, some percentages of this axis represents female,

61
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.610
since we had 300 females out of a thousand.

62
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.885
This is point three.

63
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.515
And then the rest of the area,

64
00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:42.325
the rest of the length of this line,

65
00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:44.990
is my other category male.

66
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.325
And I could have had multiple categories here.

67
00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:51.350
Instead of male and female,

68
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.940
we could have done this with a different data set for countries.

69
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.160
We could have had like North American countries, South American, Asian,

70
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.905
whatever, and we would split this up into more breaks.

71
00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:09.600
And now, this box in orangish-yellow is the percent of females.

72
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.420
This box is the percent of males.

73
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.785
And I split this with my vertical line.

74
00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:19.485
My next split is on how many people survived.

75
00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:22.880
And so what I can do is I can count for females,

76
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.080
how many survivors we had.

77
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.465
So I add up my survivors.

78
00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:29.010
I add up my non-survivors.

79
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.400
So let's say, for females,

80
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.935
we had 300 females,

81
00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:35.395
and let's say we had 200 survive,

82
00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:37.440
and 100 not survive.

83
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.065
So, that means, again, I go from zero to one on my axis,

84
00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:44.110
and I've got a total of 300.

85
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.465
So 100 out of 300 were not survivors according to our made up numbers here.

86
00:04:50.465 --> 00:04:53.345
So, that's where this line comes in.

87
00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:55.505
This goes from zero to one for my split.

88
00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:57.120
So I had more people survived,

89
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.170
and that's what's this category.

90
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.945
One means survived, zero means non-survived.

91
00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:05.585
And for male, I do the same thing except now this is the zero category.

92
00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:08.490
This larger chunk of males didn't survive, then survived.

93
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.765
So I go back to my data set,

94
00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:11.470
I add up how many males survived,

95
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.115
and how many males didn't survive.

96
00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:17.770
I did vertical.

97
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:26.135
Then I did horizontal. I can also now add other chunks like class.

98
00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:30.815
So, for example, I can split this by what class the boats were in.

99
00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:32.780
So this is how many people were in third class,

100
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.620
second class, first class.

101
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.075
Then I can look at survivors versus non-survivors.

102
00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:41.920
And we can see that the number of people that survived was smaller in each class.

103
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.075
So, first class had the most survivors.

104
00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:46.635
But I can also then split this again by gender.

105
00:05:46.635 --> 00:05:48.470
So now, I've got first class,

106
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.975
second class, third class.

107
00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:52.110
I've got male, female,

108
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.840
and survive, and not survive.

109
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.080
So, for female, my zero and one are here.

110
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.425
So, the blue is not survive,

111
00:05:58.425 --> 00:05:59.650
the yellow is survive.

112
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.225
So, in first class, almost all the females survived.

113
00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:04.690
In second class, still the majority survived.

114
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.625
And in third class, still some survived, but less.

115
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.070
With male, I've got zero to one.

116
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.835
So I can see in first class,

117
00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:16.590
many did not survive.

118
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.870
In second class, again,

119
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.410
many did not survive.

120
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.530
And in third class, the majority did not survive.

121
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.770
And so, I can again do these splits by just rotating horizontal-vertical,

122
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.130
horizontal-vertical, counting these up,

123
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.730
and putting these different percentages in my boxes.

124
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.935
Now, the question you should be asking is, well,

125
00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:41.135
remember our lecture about which visual variables are most salient to people,

126
00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:43.600
and Bill Cliven would have said, "Well,

127
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.645
you're comparing area between these different boxes."

128
00:06:46.645 --> 00:06:49.785
Area is not a very good visual variable.

129
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:52.715
So, do people really use these mosaic plots?

130
00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:55.880
Well, it's tempting to dismiss these mosaic plots because they

131
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.495
represent counts of categories as rectangular areas.

132
00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:02.215
They're providing a distorted perceptual encoding.

133
00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:06.110
But the important thing to realize is really encoding the length.

134
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.415
So, remember I'm splitting across the length here,

135
00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:13.180
and I'm always splitting along the length.

136
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.030
So at each stage, the comparison of interest is the length of

137
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.030
the side of a different box, not really the area.

138
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.510
The problem, as you can see,

139
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.455
is as we have more and more splits,

140
00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:26.360
this gets harder and harder to read,

141
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.955
harder and harder to label,

142
00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:32.585
and sometimes we can get some long and skinny boxes.

143
00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:36.890
And you can imagine that sometimes it may be that a count is so small,

144
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.880
I can't even see it, or what would happen if a count was zero?

145
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.000
How do I represent in this type of mosaic plot?

146
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.380
So, while this is a really interesting plot to look at,

147
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.310
we're actually going to see there's a similar variation of this.

148
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.960
There is a Treemap as well.

149
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.605
Later on, we'll talk about hierarchical data.

150
00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:59.770
So this is yet another tool we can put in our belt for looking

151
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.710
at how we can count categorical variables,

152
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.125
how we can represent those,

153
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:06.945
and allow people to explore,

154
00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.000
and interact with that sort of data as well.
